# Tracker for apps/games compability

All issues with your guest apps must go here. **PLEASE SEARCH IF THERE IS ALREADY AN ISSUE FOR YOUR APP AND POST THERE.**

**Do not post here MahoLator-in-general issues, post only about compability with apps.**

Langs: rus/eng, if your native language is russian, please use it. To read mixed-lang discussions use https://chromewebstore.google.com/search/translate or something like that, sorry.

If app works, feel free to post screenshots.

If app does not work, post **at least** link to your app (site with games, google drive, etc.), your ML version, linker errors and screenshots of crash/bug/etc. Logs at your `%APPDATA%`/`~/.local/share/` may help, bring them if possible.

## Issue labels

- `state:` labels reflect how well the app is supported.
- `cause:` says where the issue must be looked for.
- `ver:` is last ML version when the app was checked.
- `supports-size-sync` means that the app works with `Sync size with size of emulator window` option enabled.

## Milestones usage

Milestones are used to sort developers/vendors.
